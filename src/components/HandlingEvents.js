        Brief overview of event handling in React.
      </p>
      <p>
        Event handlers are declared in JSX (when an event handler is declared,
        under the hood React selects the relevant HTML DOM nodes and sets event
        listeners for them).
      </p>
      <p>
        Event handlers are declared as properties of React Elements. There is a
        corresponding property for each DOM event (onClick etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        Event handlers can be attached only to elements that represent DOM nodes
        and can not be attached to elements that represent user-defined
        components.
      </p>
      <p>
        React passes to event handlers instances of{' '}
        <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html'>
          <code>SyntheticEvent</code>
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>SyntheticEvent</code> is a cross-browser wrapper around the
        browserâ€™s native event (this wrapper accounts for differences in events
        implementation across different browsers).
      </p>
